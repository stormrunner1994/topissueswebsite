What has to be done in this version?

Frontpage:
-Show table of all topics sorted descending by relevance of the users
-user is able to vote the 3 top most important topics for himself
-we recognise the ip of the user, to avoid multiple votes
-save results in DB

Subpages:
- show helpful links in descending sorted order by upvotes
- for every topic we have an own page, whe user can post links
	- we check if the textline only contains links, no text
- users can upvote the links
- only show upvotes (no downvotes possible)
